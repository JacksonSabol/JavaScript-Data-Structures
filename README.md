# JavaScript Data Structures
## *Test Driven Development (TDD) Of Common Data Structures In ES6*

### The following project is an In-Progress collection of common abstract data types/structures and algorithms built with ECMAScript 2015+.

I employed JavaScript, Node.js, MochaJS, and ChaiJS to build common abstract data structures. The repository will cover Associative Arrays (JavaScript Objects), Graphs, Linked Lists, Queues, Priority Queues, Stacks, Trees, and Heaps.

# Associative Arrays:
An associative array (sometimes called a hash map, a hash table, a symbol table, or a dictionary) is what's behind the "object" in JavaScript. On a high level, it is an abstract data type composed of a collection of key-value pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection.

Put another way, the operations associated with this data type allow for:
* the addition of a pair to the collection - O(1)
* the removal of a pair from the collection - O(1)
* the modification of an existing pair - O(1)
* the lookup of a value associated with a particular key - O(1)
###### *Speeds expressed in average times and may vary depending on browser engine*
A JavaScript object most closely resembles an implementation of an associative array known as the hash table (hence the overlap in naming). A hash table is an array that utilizes a hash function to generate (hopefully) unique keys for any value passed into it. A good hash function is one that avoids hash collisions while not taking up too much space. As such, a proper implementation of an associative array should allow for constant time set, get, and remove operations, and therefore pass the following tests:
* Set a key-value pair without collisions
* Get a value associated with a key after it has been set
* Reassign the value of a key after it has been set
* Get a new value associated with a key after it has been reassigned
* Remove a key-value pair

## Code Snippet:
 ``` javascript
class AssociativeArray {
    constructor () {
        this.buckets = [];
    }
    hash(key) {
        let n = key.length - 1;
        let prime = 179424691;
        let hash = Array.from(key);
        for (let i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
            hash += (key.charCodeAt(i) * (prime ^ n)) % key.length;
            n--
        }
        return hash;
    }
}
module.exports = {
    AssociativeArray: AssociativeArray
}
 ```
